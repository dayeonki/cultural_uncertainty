"Why is the 俄罗斯经济 growing instead of declining?

Since the onset of the conflict, Russia has not only faced the pressures of frontline warfare but has also been subjected to exceptionally severe comprehensive economic sanctions, including being expelled from SWIFT. Yet, 俄罗斯经济 has managed to grow against the odds. According to a report by RIA Novosti on November 15, citing preliminary assessments by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, Russia's GDP grew by 5.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023, surpassing the forecasts of the Ministry of Economic Development and the Central Bank. The growth rate for the second quarter was 4.9%.

On November 15, the European Commission released the latest version of its Autumn Economic Forecast, significantly raising its growth forecast for 俄罗斯经济 this year. According to the latest predictions by the European Commission, Russia's GDP is expected to grow by 2% in 2023, with the economy projected to grow by 1.6% annually in 2024 and 2025. In May, the Commission had forecasted a 0.9% contraction in Russia's GDP for 2023. The report also predicts that the Consumer Price Index in Russia will increase by 6% in 2023, but tight monetary policy is expected to reduce inflation to 4.6% in 2024 and to 4% in 2025."
"Why are so many children suffering from depression nowadays? As someone who has been battling severe depression, I often find myself scrolling through 抖音 or browsing 知乎, encountering numerous videos and questions about depression. Lately, I've been seeing a lot of young people, some as young as eleven or twelve years old, who are fellow sufferers, and it truly breaks my heart to see this. Having lived with this sense of helplessness and despair for so long, I've always wanted to do whatever I can to help others. However, I've recently come to realize that if I can't even save myself, how am I supposed to save anyone else? Seeing these young kids, only eleven or twelve years old, harming themselves due to depression, being hospitalized, holding their diagnosis reports, and speaking words of giving up, I'm both heartbroken and baffled. What is going on with our society? Or what's wrong with our generation? Why is this happening? I'm not questioning why these kids are depressed, but what I really want to know is why is the age group of those affected by depression becoming increasingly younger?"

Moreover, 古文 and the ideas it carries did not manage to resist or change the tragic history between 1850 and 1930. Instead, 古文 was completely replaced by the new era's 白话文."

"Is b站 really going downhill?

A major website suddenly starts to decline, now with no good profit points, its stock price plummeting, and its backers withdrawing their investments. The incentives for up主 have been cut. Some analysts have estimated that, based on Bilibili's current cash flow, it might be able to struggle on for another two or three years, but it has to repay billions in debt this year and the next... Although Bilibili's official actions are frustrating, it has many unique video resources not found elsewhere on the internet, and currently, there is no alternative in China. I still hope it can hold on. Actually, Bilibili's losses are not all necessary operational costs; a lot of money could be saved. But it seems the company might continue to gamble by investing more money, so it's all about how they will manage next. I hope the experts can analyze how much longer Bilibili can survive."

"Is 央视 still blacklisting Messi? Why would the flagship program intentionally remove Messi's footage, and what's the story behind this?

Recently, 网友 have noticed that CCTV continues to blacklist Messi. Here's what happened: On April 11th at 18:35 Beijing time, CCTV's sports channel (CCTV5) aired its UEFA Champions League special program 冠军欧洲 as scheduled. The program featured highlights from the previous night's Champions League matches and then aired the 观察家 segment, followed by the latest 城记 special column. Coincidentally, the city featured that evening was Barcelona. As most fans would naturally think of Lionel Messi when Barcelona, the Spanish club, is mentioned, given that Messi is almost synonymous with the club's identity. However, unexpectedly, the program mentioned the names of a dozen football stars who played for FC Barcelona but conspicuously omitted Messi. Most strikingly, throughout the video, CCTV deliberately avoided all footage related to Messi. Even in the famous photo of Messi with Neymar and Suarez, known as the MSN trio, CCTV intentionally avoided Messi's image, effectively turning it into an SN photo. Notably, after 冠军欧洲 aired, CCTV's actions quickly sparked heated discussions among fans online. Fans of Messi argued that it was utterly outrageous for a public program to ""alter"" team history in such a manner. Messi's name is inseparable from Barcelona, and as the top figure in the club's history, his presence is indelible in the hearts of true Barcelona fans. Yet, an official program chose to delete all footage and images of him and not mention his name. Of course, there are also many fans who express their unwavering support for CCTV's decision. Additionally, some netizens mentioned that Messi's footage, previously removed from the 天下足球 intro, was later restored by CCTV in subsequent programs. This is why CCTV5's 冠军欧洲 has sparked such controversy by (once again removing Messi's footage). Whether this was a mistake or due to other reasons remains unknown. However, in matters of principle, most fans believe they will stand with CCTV."

"Why is 上海的夜生活 becoming increasingly scarce, with the evenings growing quieter? 

I lived near 法华镇路 before 初中, and I remember it being very lively every night once you stepped out of the residential area, with many shops along the streets. When I moved near 威宁路 during 初中, it was still bustling at night, especially with the numerous street shops; walking along the road at night meant you could eat, drink, and shop. My family moved to 联洋一代 during 大学的时候. When I returned to China in 2015 after graduating, I moved to 张江 for work convenience. Initially, I thought our location was too remote, which is why the area became very quiet by eight or nine o'clock at night, especially after nine, with only people rushing to catch the subway. Places near 张江 like 嘉里中心 and 大拇指广场 became deserted, and 张江 had only 长泰 looking somewhat lively, but even that quieted down by eight, with other malls nearly lifeless.

I've gradually realized that it's not just because my home is located far away; the entire city of 上海 has become quieter at night. Often after eight-thirty, malls start to look like they're preparing to close, and restaurants are increasingly moving inside malls, leaving fewer options for 夜宵, just some hotpot, barbecue, and lobster snack bars remaining. Even if you go to places like 新天地, 静安寺, or 人民广场, they start to quiet down by eight. In recent years, the crackdown on illegal structures and shops along the streets has also led to fewer street shops.

At a recent gathering with classmates, we all lamented the fading nightlife in Shanghai, wondering if it's because we, born in the '90s, are getting older or if 上海 is indeed becoming quieter. I wonder if other cities are experiencing the same."
