Why would the flagship program intentionally remove Messi's footage, and what's the story behind this?\n\nRecently, netizens have noticed that CCTV continues to blacklist Messi. Here's what happened: On April 11th at 18:35 Beijing time, CCTV's sports channel (CCTV5) aired its UEFA Champions League special program \"Champions of Europe\" as scheduled. The program featured highlights from the previous night's Champions League matches and then aired the \"Observer\" segment, followed by the latest \"City Tales\" special column. Coincidentally, the city featured that evening was Barcelona. As most fans would naturally think of Lionel Messi when Barcelona, the Spanish club, is mentioned, given that Messi is almost synonymous with the club's identity. However, unexpectedly, the program mentioned the names of a dozen football stars who played for FC Barcelona but conspicuously omitted Messi. Most strikingly, throughout the video, CCTV deliberately avoided all footage related to Messi. Even in the famous photo of Messi with Neymar and Suarez, known as the MSN trio, CCTV intentionally avoided Messi's image, effectively turning it into an SN photo. Notably, after \"Champions of Europe\" aired, CCTV's actions quickly sparked heated discussions among fans online. Fans of Messi argued that it was utterly outrageous for a public program to \"alter\" team history in such a manner. Messi's name is inseparable from Barcelona, and as the top figure in the club's history, his presence is indelible in the hearts of true Barcelona fans. Yet, an official program chose to delete all footage and images of him and not mention his name. Of course, there are also many fans who express their unwavering support for CCTV's decision. Additionally, some netizens mentioned that Messi's footage, previously removed from the \"World of Football\" intro, was later restored by CCTV in subsequent programs. This is why CCTV5's \"Champions of Europe\" has sparked such controversy by (once again removing Messi's footage). Whether this was a mistake or due to other reasons remains unknown. However, in matters of principle, most fans believe they will stand with CCTV.", "answer": "Answerable", "token_prob_pairs": [["Answer", 0.9999], ["able", 1.0], ["", 0.6786]], "answerability_prob": 0.9999}

When I moved near Weining Road during junior high, it was still bustling at night, especially with the numerous street shops; walking along the road at night meant you could eat, drink, and shop. My family moved to the Lianyang area during my university years. When I returned to China in 2015 after graduating, I moved to Zhangjiang for work convenience. Initially, I thought our location was too remote, which is why the area became very quiet by eight or nine o'clock at night, especially after nine, with only people rushing to catch the subway. Places near Lianyang like Kerry Center and Thumb Plaza became deserted, and Zhangjiang had only Longtai looking somewhat lively, but even that quieted down by eight, with other malls nearly lifeless.\n\nI've gradually realized that it's not just because my home is located far away; the entire city of Shanghai has become quieter at night. Often after eight-thirty, malls start to look like they're preparing to close, and restaurants are increasingly moving inside malls, leaving fewer options for late-night snacks, just some hotpot, barbecue, and lobster snack bars remaining. Even if you go to places like Xintiandi, Jing'an Temple, or Renmin Square, they start to quiet down by eight. In recent years, the crackdown on illegal structures and shops along the streets has also led to fewer street shops.\n\nAt a recent gathering with classmates, we all lamented the fading nightlife in Shanghai, wondering if it's because we, born in the '90s, are getting older or if Shanghai is indeed becoming quieter. I wonder if other cities are experiencing the same.", "answer": "Answerable", "token_prob_pairs": [["Answer", 0.9999], ["able", 1.0], ["", 0.7053]], "answerability_prob": 0.9999}
